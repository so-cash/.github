## What is so|cash ?
Sustainable & Open Cash Framework (so|cash) is an EVM open source blockchain protocol that enables the banking industry to operate deposit accounts in a generic shared IT infrastructure. Like a DeFI protocol all users can use and benefit from the model as long as they respect the rules (the standard). But unlike a DeFI protocol, so|cash is built to respect the laws and regulations of the banking industry.

Concretely, a bank, licensed to offer deposit accounts, deploys a smart contracts in a EVM compatible blockchain that acts as a back office program in which accounts can be created, maintained and payments operated.

Because of the nature of the underlying blockchain infrastructure, the account holders can autonomously and instantly access its accounts and make payments. Such cash transfers are consequently reaching their beneficiary at exactly the same instant as it is leaving the account (real instant payment).

With such a program, respecting a set of standard interfaces, banks can make their back office systems talk to each other without relying on asynchronous messages transported by thrid party providers. In particular a payment can occur between accounts in two different banks within a single program operation, making the transfer fully atomic (both debit and credit succeed or none happen) and instantaneous (both debit and credit have the same timestamp).

Because the underlying blockchain infrastructure can be a shared ledger (also refered as "unified ledgder") between various asset classes and businesses, such payment solution is easilly programmable, leveraging the benefits of executing a payment when conditions are met or triggering a delivery when a payment is effective.

## How so|cash payment work ?
Sustainable & Open Cash Framework (so|cash) is an EVM open source blockchain protocol enabling banks to open deposit accounts for their clients. 
The smart contract of the bank exposes a few interfaces (for the client, for other banks, for its back office and internal systems). Technical documentation is provided at https://github.com/so-cash.

When a client wants to operate a payment from its account to a beneficiary account in the same bank, the client (or a program acting for the client) will call the 'transfer' function on the account and the back office smart contract will identify the beneficiary account, ensure it exists, that credits are allowed (incl AML/CTF), ensures that the payer's account has enough funds then in a single operation debit the amount from the account to credit it to the beneficiary account. This generates a unique payment identifier and generates an event to report it.

When the beneficiary's account is in a different bank, and assuming that this bank has a vostro account with the beneficiary's bank, then the bank smart contract performs (all in a single operation) the controls, the transfer of the amount from the client's account to the vostro of the beneficiary's bank, calls the beneficiary's bank smart contract to credit the beneficiary. Inside the same operation, the beneficiary's bank checks that its nostro (ie the vostro) has been credited, performs controls on the payment and credit the beneficiary's account.
At then end of this atomic blockchain operation, the beneficiary's bank has an increased balance in its nostro account at the paying bank. This balance bears a credit risk and prudence recommends that it is converted into a central bank balance (assuming the bank has access to central bank money in that currency). 

Therefore, the beneficiary's bank will initiate a transfer from its nostro to its reserve account and this is where so|cash model integrates with a wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (and any other interbank settlement solution) using DeFI like bridge involving time locking scheme (HTLC)

## How so|cash compare to stablecoins and tokenized deposits ?
Sustainable & Open Cash Framework (so|cash) is an EVM open source blockchain protocol that has the benefits of both stablecoins and tokenized deposits, the usual private sector alternatives for privately issued money.

Inspired initially by both alternatives, so|cash keeps the best of both worlds:

Stablecoins inherit from DeFI their technical standard and provide a great interoperability solution in blockchain ecosystems. They however rely on different regulation that conventional money and (in MiCA) forbid holders to earn interests on their balance. Additionally, the issuer of the stable coin is unique (or a formal cooperation) and has to keep an equivalent amount of collateral that cannot be part of the bank liquidity for financing the economy.

Tokenized deposits inherit from the banking industry their regulation and provide a great solution for banks to operate their deposit accounts in a shared IT infrastructure. They however cannot be transferred directly to another bank as they embed a relationship between the bank and the account holder. Additionally, most of the tokenized deposits are currently in private chains and rely on a single operator (either for a bank or a consortium of banks).

As the table below shows, so|cash provides the benefits of any digital form of private money (instant payment, atomic DvP, 
CBDC compatible) without the limitations of stablecoins and tokenized deposits. To leverage that benefits, banks should adopt so|cashs as a common standard and agree on a shared infrastructure.

## ECB wCBDC ongoing experimentations with so|cash
CrÃ©dit Agricole CIB and CACEIS are experimenting the use of EUR wCBDC in conjunction with the so|cash protocol with the legal support of White&Case. 

The objectives of the tests are to demonstrate the interoperability model of wCBDC, using Banque de France solution, DL3S, with a decentralized correspondent banking protocol, so|cash, and assess the feasibility and merit of a unified ledger of commercial bank money for the banking industry.

The tests are conducted in a sandbox environment with fictive clients, accounts and balances. The setup puts in situation 3 banks, CACIB and CACEIS with wCBDC wallets at Banque de France and a fictive European bank with a wCBDC wallet with a fictive local central bank. Each bank has deployed a dedicated so|cash compatible back office module and established a correspondent banking relationship with the other banks.

The construction of the tests and the technology has enabled the participants to deepen the understanding of the mechanism and requirements of a decentralized, tokenized, instant, atomic correspondent banking model and the impacts on clients, banks and central banks existing infrastructure and organisation.
CrÃ©dit Agricole group invited European banks to contribute to the tests with their feedback on dedicated observation sessions and their inputs are very valuable to complete the picture and reach consensus on the model : SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, BNPP, Santander, SEB. Thanks for this.

A detailed publication will be made when the experiments are completed to expose the learning and the way so|cash can operate in a multi banks environment, in conjuction with a wCBDC interoperability model.

However, to date, we can share that the technology allows for a cooperative interbank protocol, where each bank remains fully autonomous from any provider, maintain competition while upskilling their payment infrastructure and offer instant cash management services to their client and themselves. In addition, this approach appears to respond well to instantaneity of the financial flows (payment and delivery) that puts pressure on corporates and banks treasury departments.
